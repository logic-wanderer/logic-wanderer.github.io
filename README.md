### Background 

Wanderer is a UNIX-based game written by Steve Shipway in 1988 and contributed to by others [(see credits here)](wanderer-credits.txt).  While it has been ported to DOS, Linux, Android and Java, I've not found a version anywhere that is widely accessible on any device.  This version attempts to fill the gap.

[This Android port](misc/wanderer.apk) by Andreas Grothe used to be available on Google Play a few years back.  It still works fine on my Android though I take no responsibility for the app.

### Technical notes

This is a not a port of the  original code but a complete rewrite in Javascript.  There are some subtle differences in the way that some of the more complex event sequences play out.  I will work to try and resolve these.  But most levels tested so far seem unaffected.

I've not yet implemented proper level progression logic.  For now anyone can play any level.
